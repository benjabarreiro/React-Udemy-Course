Is another React hook that will help use with state management (like useState with more capabilities) 

Sometimes you have more complex state - for example if it got multiple states, multiple ways of changing it ir dependencies to other states.
then useState() often becomes hard or error-prone to use - it's easy to write bad, inefficient or buggy code in such scenarios.

useReducer can be uses as a replacement for useState() if you need more powerful state management.
