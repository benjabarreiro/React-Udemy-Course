Rules of Hooks

- Only call React Hooks in React functions:
a) react component functions
b) custom Hooks

- Only call react hooks at the top level:
a) don't call them in nested functions
b) don't call them in any block statements

- unofficial rulle for useEffect:
--> always add everything you refer to inside of useEffect() as a dependency unless there is a good reason no to do it.
