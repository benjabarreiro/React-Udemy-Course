all UI are made up of components

components are reusable building blocks for the UI.
They allow us separate our concerns, meaning keeping our code base small and manageable.


all components are a combination of html, css and js.

declerative approach: you will not tell React that some html element should be created and inserted. Here you define the desired state and let React decide which one to insert.
